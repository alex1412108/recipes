Ingredients
1 egg white, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon water
3 cups pecan halves
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions
Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
In a small bowl beat the eggs white with the water. Stir in the Pecans, mixing until well moistened.
In a small bowl, mix together sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Sprinkle over the moistened nuts. Spread nuts on prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes, stiring once or twice. Be careful not to overcook and burn the nuts.

Notes
For my oven, a cooking cycle of 8 minutes-stir-7 minutes-stir-4 minutes worked bestl.
For high humidity environments, after the pecans have cooled for 10 minutes seal them in an airtight container (or else they will get sticky).
